            <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
            <p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, 
                for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, 
                save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</p>

            <h2>Ether 4:12</h2>
            <p>12 And whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do good is of me; for good cometh of none save it be of me. 
                I am the same that leadeth men to all good; he that will not believe my words will not believe meâ€”that I am; 
                and he that will not believe me will not believe the Father who sent me. For behold, I am the Father, I am the light, and the life, and the truth of the world.</p>
