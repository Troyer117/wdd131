        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>This site is to easily help people find the cards they are looking for in an easier and more reliable way. 
            This site will help people find up-to-date cards and the specific ones they are looking for, which will in turn help them find 
            those cards on other sites where they can buy them.</p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>This site is for people ages 8-40 or anyone interested in playing or collecting the trading card game Yu-Gi-Oh.</p>

        <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
        <p>I'll be making this site mostly around a search engine that will allow users to search for cards by name and use a filter that can find cards by type, subtype, and/or attribute. 
            This will be done using a JavaScript function that will filter through a list of cards and display the results on the page. 
            I'll be using an OR logic for the search but make it so that it shows accurate results on top first. 
            Then when clicked it will store it to display it onto another subpage where it will display all the cards you selected on there.</p>

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

        <h3>Home</h3>
        <p>The arrows will be some images you can go through</p>
        <img src="images/Home.png" alt="home page wireframe" />

        <h3>Page 2</h3>
        <p>Could possibly expand to more images depending one what you search and could possibly put more content in there than what I have, although I might change it to 2 cards per row instead of three, seeing how much info I need to put on the cards</p>
        <img src="images/Page_2.png" alt="page 2 wireframe" />

        <h3>Page 3</h3>
        <p>Same with page 2 where it could expand beyond the images I put in there, although forgot to put an image on the bottom right of each card for a trash can to delete images from that page</p>
